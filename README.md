# NLPLand

This repository is part of the project titled "NLPLand and its Secrets".
The project is within the scope of the Information Retrieval course at the Bergische University of Wuppertal in the summer semester of 2021.
The following project description should give a broad overview over the project, but is subject to change.

### Project Description
The ACL Anthology (AA) is the largest single repository of thousands of articles on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL). It contains valuable metadata (e.g. venues, authorsâ€™ name, title) that can be used to better understand the field. NLP Scholar, uses this data to examine the literature to identify broad trends in productivity, focus, and impact. We want to extend this analysis to specific components in NLP publications.

**Goal:** Create an in-depth map of the publications in NLP and how their topics affect each other over time in their main venues (We will adjust this a bit better)

**Project Tasks:**
- Review on a system that analyzes NLP Scholar dataset, and Google Scholar
- Incorporate semantic modeling to identify overlapping topics (e.g. embeddings, transformers, language models)
- Map how new and traditional topics behave over time in ACL venues
- Investigate the dynamic between venues and topics
