PROJECT OVERVIEW

This work examines Natural Language Processing (NLP) research literature to
identify broad trends in productivity, focus, and impact. To do so, we
extracted and aligned the information in the ACL Anthology (AA) and Google
Scholar (GS).  We present the analyses in a sequence of questions and answers.
The goal is to record the state of the NLP literature: who and how many of us
are publishing? what are we publishing on? where and in what form are we
publishing? and what is the impact of our publications? The answers are usually
in the form of numbers, graphs, and inter-connected visualizations. Special
emphasis is laid on the demographics and inclusiveness of NLP publishing. 

The work is presented in a number of ways, including:
-- a series of Medium blog posts on the state of NLP literature
-- research articles published at ACL-2020 and other venues (listed in the 
   section below) 
-- a number of interactive visualizations (to be available shortly; for now 
   please see the figures in the papers and blog posts)


DATA 

Papers are taken from the ACL Anthology. Citation information is taken from
Google Scholar author profiles. Date of data extraction: June 2020.  Currently
this package includes one tab-separated master data file:
nlp-scholar-papers-vJune2020.txt.  The dataset and its creation are described in
detail in the LREC-2020 paper listed at the bottom of this page.  

(Note that an earlier version of the package included data extracted in June 2019. 
That data was the source of experiments and analyses in the papers listed at the 
bottom of this page.)

Each row in the data file corresponds to a paper. The columns correspond to
various pieces of information about the paper that were obtained from:

-- ACL Anthology (AA): these columns have names that start with AA
-- Google Scholar (GS): these columns have names that start with GS
-- additional information generated as part of the NLP Scholar (NS) project: 
   these columns have names that start with NS

Examples of AA columns include: AA title, AA first author first name, AA year
of publication, etc. Examples of GS columns include: GS title, GS citations, GS
year of publication, etc.  Examples of NS columns include: NS title-year id, 
NS tutorial flag, NS paper type, etc.

Note that the nature of automatic extraction, alignment, and processing entails 
some amount of errors. Some of the columns, such as NS doctoral consortium flag,
NS tutorial flag, etc., may miss data simply because the relevant information
is not explicitly marked for some of the papers in the ACL Anthology.

The column names are usually self-explanatory. However, I will continue to
update this README to add more information.  Meanwhile, feel free to contact me
(uvgotsaif@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

Note that some columns have the same information about the paper from both AA
and GS, for example, the paper title and year of publication. However, the
information may not always match for columns such as year of publication, as
Google sometimes records the arxiv year of publication.

The information across AA and GS was aligned using the 'NS title-year id'
column. It is essentially a concatenation of the lowercased title (after
removing any white spaces and non-alphanumeric characters) and the year of
publication. (In cases where the year in GS is different due to a preprint,
first author name is used instead.)

Starting in 2020, ACL Anthology changed the codes used to represent venues.
For example, until 2019 ACL was represented by code 'P', but since 2020 it
is represented by 'acl'. Thus 'AA venue code' has different codes for the same
venue depending on whether the entry is pre Jan 1 2020 or post Jan 1 2020.
'NS venue name' maps the different codes for the same venue to a common string.
Thus entries for main conference papers from ACL have 'NS venue name' = 'ACL'
regardless of year.
